# WENO - FVM Compressible Euler Equation Solver

This repository is for storing codes in different stage to develop a 2D/3D compressible Euler equation by application of WENO and FVM.

The project is seperated into several stages:
- 1D Burger's equation
- 1D Euler equation
- 2D Euler equation
- 2D Euler Equation with IBM
- 2D Euler Equation with IBM and AMR
